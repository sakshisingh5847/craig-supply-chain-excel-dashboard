# 📦 Supply Chain Performance Dashboard

This Excel-based dashboard was created to explore and visualize key supply chain KPIs. While the data is synthetic, the metrics and layout reflect real-world logistics reporting — from carrier performance to sales trends.

Beyond showcasing my **Excel and dashboarding skills**, this project highlights how my background in logistics shapes how I interpret and communicate operational data.

## 📈 Why I Built This

With over **10 years of experience in container ship planning** and a few years in **automotive logistics**, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges of tracking and interpreting performance data. Many reports I worked with were dense and hard to translate into action.

I built this dashboard as a **clear and actionable way to monitor supply chain performance** — blending what I’ve learned from my career with my current studies in **data analytics and business intelligence** through the **Google BI Analyst course**.

This project helped me practice:
- Pulling actionable insights from operational data
- Presenting findings in a clean, user-friendly dashboard
- Thinking like a logistics manager or operations lead
